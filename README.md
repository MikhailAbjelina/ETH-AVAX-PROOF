# ETH-AVAX-PROOF
This project demonstrates the require(), assert(), and revert() functions in Solidity

## Description
The project is a hypothetical banking system that uses the checking and error handling functionality of require(), assert(), and revert().
The balance in the system is set to 0 so the user must first enter a value to deposit and allow for withdrawal.
